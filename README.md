# Easter Egg Hunt
This Easter, there will be a lack of excitment due to the current lockdown situation in New Zealand.  This is here to provide you entertainment during this time, and to enjoy scouting the websites which mention easter and they will have a beautiful egg waiting for you!

If you would like to contribute an egg to the project, please email a .png of any size to michaela.kerrr@gmail.com

## What is this?
A way to keep me and everyone else in NZ occupied when they may or may not be with their families, and still want to have an easter egg hunt.

This extension looks at the URL of a page and if it contains the word easter, and the page contains images, then this will insert an egg after the first image.  THis may be a header, an ad, or something else. 

Currently, due to my inability to draw eggs, there is only one (now five!), but if you would like more, please email some more eggs to me!

Please note: if you send me eggs, you will have to install the new version with your eggs in it! Otherwise they won't appear.
